Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that simplifies application deployment and management. Applications deployed in PCF do not rely on container images directly like Docker but instead follow a distinct architecture and process for building and running applications. Here’s an overview:

PCF Deployment Architecture
	1.	Applications in PCF:
	•	Applications are deployed as source code or precompiled artifacts (e.g., JAR, WAR, or Node.js apps).
	•	Developers push their code to PCF using the cf CLI.
	2.	Buildpacks:
	•	PCF uses buildpacks to transform the application source code into a runnable artifact.
	•	Buildpacks detect the application type (e.g., Java, Python, Node.js) and apply the necessary dependencies and configuration.
	3.	Droplets:
	•	Once the buildpack processes the application, it creates a droplet—a package containing the application and its runtime dependencies.
	•	The droplet is stored in PCF’s Blobstore and then executed within a Diego container.
	4.	Diego Cells:
	•	PCF uses Diego as its container orchestration system.
	•	The application is deployed to a Diego container on one of the Diego Cells, which are the worker nodes in PCF.

Steps to Deploy Applications in PCF
	1.	Push Application:
	•	Developers use the cf push command to deploy their application.
	•	Example:

cf push my-app -p path/to/app


	2.	Build Process:
	•	PCF selects an appropriate buildpack based on the application type.
	•	The buildpack installs the necessary dependencies and configures the environment.
	•	A droplet is created.
	3.	Application Deployment:
	•	The droplet is pushed to the Blobstore.
	•	Diego schedules and runs the application in a container.
	4.	Route Assignment:
	•	PCF maps a route (URL) to the application so that it can be accessed externally.

PCF Application Architecture
	•	Cloud Controller: Manages application lifecycle (staging, starting, stopping).
	•	Router: Handles routing requests to applications based on the route (URL).
	•	Diego Cells: Run applications in containers, managed by the Diego orchestrator.
	•	Blobstore: Stores application droplets, buildpacks, and other metadata.
	•	Service Broker: Connects applications with services (e.g., databases, messaging systems).

How Images are Built in PCF

PCF doesn’t use traditional Docker images but instead relies on droplets created by buildpacks. If containerization is required, PCF has integrations with Kubernetes or supports deploying custom Docker containers.
	1.	Using Buildpacks:
	•	Buildpacks are the default method for building and packaging applications.
	•	A buildpack automatically creates the droplet.
	2.	Using Docker Images:
	•	PCF also allows developers to push Docker images instead of source code.
	•	Example:

cf push my-app --docker-image my-image

Key Advantages of PCF Architecture
	1.	Developer Productivity: Abstracts infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus on code.
	2.	Buildpacks: Simplifies dependency management.
	3.	Resilience and Scaling: Automatic container orchestration with Diego.
	4.	Integrated Services: Easy binding of applications to services like databases and messaging queues.
