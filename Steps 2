PCF Deployment Architecture Explanation

The Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) architecture is designed to simplify deploying, running, and scaling cloud-native applications. Here’s how a typical PCF deployment architecture would look, based on the CI/CD pipeline discussed:

PCF Deployment Architecture Overview

PCF uses a microservices-based architecture to host, manage, and scale applications. Key components in the deployment architecture include:
	1.	Developer Workstation:
	•	Developers write code, which is committed to a version control system (e.g., GitHub/GitLab).
	2.	CI/CD Pipeline Tools:
	•	Jenkins for CI: Automates build, test, and artifact creation.
	•	Harness for CD: Manages automated deployments to PCF environments.
	3.	PCF Foundation:
	•	Comprises runtime components and platform services for deploying and managing applications.
	•	Example PCF layers:
	•	Diego Cells: Run application instances (containers).
	•	Router: Routes incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the correct application instance.
	•	BOSH Director: Manages the underlying infrastructure.
	•	Blobstore: Stores application packages, buildpacks, and other artifacts.
	4.	Load Balancer and DNS:
	•	Directs external traffic to the PCF router for load distribution and routing.
	5.	Application Environment:
	•	Applications are deployed to specific spaces and organizations within PCF.
	•	PCF environments typically include:
	•	Development: Internal testing and experimentation.
	•	Staging/QA: Pre-production testing.
	•	Production: Live, customer-facing environment.

Deployment Architecture Workflow with PCF Example

1. Code Flow to Artifact:
	•	Developer Workflow:
	•	A developer writes a Spring Boot microservice (e.g., customer-service) and pushes the code to GitHub.
	•	Example GitHub repository: github.com/org/customer-service.
	•	Jenkins CI Pipeline:
	•	Jenkins detects the code push via a webhook.
	•	It builds the application using Maven, runs unit tests, and packages the application into a deployable artifact (customer-service.jar).

2. Artifact Flow to Deployment:
	•	Harness CD Pipeline:
	•	Harness fetches the .jar artifact from Artifactory.
	•	The deployment process starts with Harness targeting a specific PCF environment (e.g., Dev, QA, or Production).

3. PCF Deployment Process:
	•	Harness uses PCF CLI commands or APIs to deploy the application:

cf push customer-service -p customer-service.jar --random-route


	•	PCF Deployment Details:
	•	Organization: finance-org
	•	Space: production-space
	•	Instances: 3 (3 containers running the app in Diego cells)
	•	Memory per Instance: 1 GB
	•	PCF automatically handles:
	•	Routing: Generates a route like customer-service.apps.prod.example.com.
	•	Scaling: Adds or removes instances based on demand.
	•	Service Binding: Connects the application to external services (e.g., databases).

4. External Traffic Flow:
	•	A load balancer directs traffic to the PCF router.
	•	The router forwards requests to one of the available instances in the Diego cells.

  [External Traffic]
       |
Customer Requests (e.g., `customer-service.apps.prod.example.com`)

Example Details
	•	Application Name: customer-service
	•	PCF Foundation:
	•	Hosted on AWS or private data center infrastructure.
	•	Load balancer handles domain routing (e.g., *.apps.prod.example.com).
	•	Routing Example:
	•	User makes a request to https://customer-service.apps.prod.example.com.
	•	The request flows through the PCF Router, which routes it to an available application instance in Diego Cells.
	•	Scaling Example:
	•	PCF scales customer-service instances from 3 to 6 automatically during high traffic using configured autoscaling rules.

Key Benefits of This Architecture
	1.	Platform Independence: PCF abstracts infrastructure, enabling applications to run on any cloud or data center.
	2.	Efficient Traffic Routing: The PCF router efficiently routes traffic to the correct application instance.
	3.	Autoscaling: Diego cells manage scaling based on demand.
	4.	Service Integration: Easy binding with external databases, message brokers, etc.

This architecture ensures a robust, scalable, and automated deployment process.
